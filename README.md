## What is this?

This is an example README template I have put together for use in my personal projects here on GitHub.  It only needs a few specifc adjustments to fit any project.

## Technologies

I normally would include links, plus a description of technologies used (if applicable).  For a major project, this is a good idea, but for something small, maybe just a link would suffice.

#### For Example:

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

    - A framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.

* [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

    - A collection of CSS3 powered hover effects to be applied to links, buttons, logos, SVG, featured images and so on. Easily apply to your own elements, modify or just use for inspiration. Available in CSS, Sass, and LESS.

* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

    - Just add water CSS animations

## Files 

I'm not sure if this section is necessary, as you can see this in the actual repo directory, but I might do more research to see if something like this is more common/useful than not.



* root
    * index.html
    * README.MD
* assets
    * hover-min.css
    * project-1.css
* js
    * jquery-3.4.1.min.js
    * require.js
    * script.js

## Functionality

This is where we discuss how to use the software/app/etc.  For example, for our project 'MeDo':

* Currently, No Installation necessary.  Simply navigate to [the Medo webpage](https://mpaitgt.github.io/Medo-frontend/) to begin using.
* Google Chrome is our recommended web browser, but your preferred browser will work as well.
* User can input an artist/movie's name and add them to their respective list
* A list item will display the following:
    * The tile of the artist/band
    * The amount of time that has passed since the item was first added
    * A like button 
    * A removed button
